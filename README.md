# Text Editor
This project is a Swing-based text editor developed in Java. The Swing Text Editor provides a simple yet functional graphical user interface for creating, editing, and saving text files. With features like changing font size and style, adjusting text and background color, and basic text manipulation options (such as copy, paste, and cut), it offers a user-friendly experience for working with text documents.

## Key Features:
- **Intuitive GUI:** The text editor features a clean and intuitive graphical user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and perform various text editing tasks.
- **Font Customization:** Users can customize the font size, font family, and font style (bold, italic) according to their preferences.
- **Color Customization:** The text and background colors can be customized to enhance readability and personalize the editor's appearance.
- **Basic Text Manipulation:** Standard text manipulation features such as copy, paste, and cut are provided to facilitate efficient text editing.
- **File Operations:** Users can create new text files, open existing files, and save changes to files directly from the editor's interface.

## How to Use:
- **Download/Clone the Repository:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine using Git or GitHub's download feature.
- **Compile the Java Code:** Compile the Java source files using your preferred Java compiler or IDE.
- **Run the Text Editor:** Run the Main class to launch the Swing Text Editor application.
- **Explore the Features:** Explore the various features of the text editor, such as font customization, color options, and file operations.
- **Create/Edit Text Files:** Use the text editor to create new text files, open existing files, and edit text content as needed.
- **Save Changes:** Save any changes made to text files using the "Save" menu option.
- **Exit the Application:** Exit the text editor application by selecting the "Exit" menu option or closing the application window.


## Testing:
The Swing Text Editor project is accompanied by a robust suite of unit tests designed to ensure the reliability, functionality, and usability of the application. These tests cover a wide range of features, including GUI elements, text manipulation capabilities, file operations, and user interactions.
### Key Testing Categories:
- **GUI Component Testing:** Verifies the correct initialization and behavior of GUI components such as the text area (pad), font size spinner (textSizeSpinner), font combo box (fontBox), and various buttons for text formatting.
- **Text Manipulation Testing:** Ensures that the application accurately handles text manipulation tasks such as changing font styles (bold, italic), converting text case (uppercase, lowercase), and adjusting text colors and background colors.
- **File Operations Testing:** Validates the functionality of file-related operations, including opening, saving, copying, pasting, and cutting text within the editor, as well as interacting with external text files.
- **Menu Item Testing:** Tests the behavior of menu items such as creating a new instance of the text editor, opening and saving text files, exiting the application, and performing copy, paste, and cut operations via the menu bar.

## Comprehensive Test Coverage:
The test suite is designed to cover various use cases and edge cases to ensure the application's stability and correctness under different scenarios. Each test case targets specific functionalities and user interactions, providing comprehensive coverage of the Swing Text Editor's capabilities.

### Continuous Validation:
The tests are regularly executed as part of the development process to validate new features, bug fixes, and enhancements. Continuous integration and automated testing pipelines help maintain the quality and reliability of the application over time.

### Feedback and Contributions:
Feedback, bug reports, and contributions to the test suite are welcome and encouraged. Developers can contribute additional test cases, improve existing tests, or report any issues encountered during testing to help enhance the reliability and effectiveness of the application.
